	It's now 3pm, and we're here doing the demo for our TodoList the GREAT.
	Let me try thinking about some cases here:

	Jim got several things to do in mind, so he type in these following:

add !1 Celebrate the success of this demo @McDonald 7pm #CS2103
add Do tutorial @library for CS2104 20:00 ~ 22:00 #study
add Sleep at 11:30 pm tonight
add Lunch with mom tomorrow 12:30 @home #life
add Play PC games @home today 11pm ~ tomorrow 4am !3
add Refactor the code for CS2103 @(SOC Basement) #CS2103 this Saturday for 6 hours

	then he want to see what task he exactly what catogory he has typed in
dis

	and he is quite curious about what's in #study:
#study

	he want to see the default list (inbox):
#

	then he want to see all the tasks he currently has
/

	then he want to see the tasks do at home
/@home

	then he want to get the very low priority task
/!3

	and then he want to delete it
del 1
	he want to check the high priority task, and do
/!1

	then he see want he need to do, so save the application and exit happily.
exit
