5.3 - Java Big Integer:
 - infinite precision
 - extra feature: 
    1. base convention
    2. powmod
    3. gcd
5.4 - Combinatorics
 - Fibonacci
 - Binomial Coefficient
 - Catalan Numbers: # to build distinct binary tree with n element
5.5 - Number Theory
 - prime numbers:
    - sieve of eratosthenes
 - GCD/LCM:
    - Eucid Algorithm to find out gcd
    - LCM = a * b / gcd
 - Modulo Arithmetic:
    - (a + b) % c = (a % c + b % c) % c
    - (a * b) % c = (a % c * b % c) % c
    - doesn't work on division
 - Extended Euclid
5.6 - Probability
5.7 - Cycle Finding:
 - Floyd's Cycle-Finding Alg: tortoise and hare alg
5.8 - Game Theory
 - Decision Tree
5.9 - Power of Square Matrix:
 - Square Matrix Exponentiation: O(n^3 * log(n))


Tricks & Techniques:
1. To represent the maximum int, one can use 0x7fffffff
2. When using bool array, one may simply use vector<bool> instead of bitset, cuz the vector<bool> has been optimized (so that each would take 1 bit only) alread
