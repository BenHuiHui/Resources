Book Review for Chapter 8

Problem Decomposition
    - Binary Search + Greedy/MCBM/SSSP/Max Flow
    - SSSP + DP: SSSP to translate, DP to calculate
More Avanced Search Tech
    - Informed Search: A* -- a greedy search
    - Depth Limited Search -- when we know the maximum depth
    - Iterative Deepening Search -- BFS overall + DFS in shellow layers.

Question / Unclear:
    UVA 10816: 
        it's classified as "Binary Search", but I don't understand where the "binary search" comes from.
        to solve this question, one can do two dijkstra's. First time find the min allowed temperature, then second time build the map of distance, only put in those route with temperature < minT, and do a dijkstra's on Distance.
