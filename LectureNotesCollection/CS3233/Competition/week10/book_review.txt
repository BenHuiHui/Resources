Suffix Tree

Application
- String Matching: to find all occurrences of P(length m) in T(length n)
    - search for the vertex x in suffix tree which represents P
    - all the leaves in the subtree rooted at x are the occurerences
- Longest Repeated Substring: find the longest repeated substring in T
    - Find the deepest internal node
- Longest Repeated SubString of string A and B:
    - Build surfix tree of string A
    - merge it with that of string B
    - color the common code
    - Find the longest colored node

Suffix Array
Application:
- Longest Commong Substring of two string:
    - connect the two string with a unique char "."
