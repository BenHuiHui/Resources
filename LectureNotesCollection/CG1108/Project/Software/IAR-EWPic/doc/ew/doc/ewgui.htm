<h3>
<a NAME="important"></a>Important information</h3>

<h4>
Files needed for uninstallation of the product</h4>

<ul>After installing the IAR Embedded Workbench, you may notice that a
number of files have been placed in a subdirectory to your "Program files"
directory. These files are needed for the InstallShield Wizard to be able
to uninstall the IAR Embedded Workbench. Although deleting these files
does not affect the operation of the IAR Embedded Workbench, it does mean
that you cannot automatically uninstall it.</ul>

<h4>
Miscellaneous error dialogs during building</h4>

<ul>If you repeatedly get error dialogs giving generic error messages like
"Error running tool" when building a particular file, the likely cause
is a problem in the tool, not in the IAR Embedded Workbench itself. Most
probably the tool runs into problems dealing with a particular construct
in the input file. There are two different ways of finding the cause of
the problem:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol type="#">
<li>
If you have a command-line version of the tool available, run it with the
same options and note if it produces any error messages. (The options used
when running a tool in the IAR Embedded Workbench can be seen in the Message
window if message filtering is set to "all".)</li>

<li>
Try to comment out part of the input using #ifdef/#endif, and see if that
makes any difference.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>The cause of the problem may be erroneus input (which arguably should
be reported properly from the tool) or it may be a program error.</ul>

<h4>
External editor configuration</h4>

<ul>As different DDE capable editors use different commands, it is necessary
to consult the user documentation supplied with your editor to find the
correct command syntax.
<p>Here are some example configurations for particular editors:
<p>EasyCase
<ul>
<pre>Editor:&nbsp; C:\EASY\Easy-cpp.exe
Service: easy-cpp
Command: system [line($CUR_LINE$)] [load("$FILE_PATH$")]</pre>
</ul>
Codewright
<ul>
<pre>Editor:&nbsp; c:\cw32\cw32.exe
Service: Codewright
Command: System BufEditFile $FILE_PATH$&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $FILE_PATH$ MovToLine $CUR_LINE$</pre>
</ul>
Note that there seems to be a problem with Codewright that can cause the
selected buffer to be activated in the background, but when bringing Codewright
to the foreground, it may revert to the previously selected buffer. To
work around that problem, use this command configuration instead:
<ul>
<pre>System OutputWindow=1
System BufEditFile $FILE_PATH$
$FILE_PATH$ MovToLine $CUR_LINE$</pre>
</ul>
The first command is equivalent to clicking on a tab in the Codewright
Output Window, bringing it to the foreground before the other commands
are issued.</ul>

<h4>
Avoiding absolute paths in project options</h4>

<ul>In IAR Embedded Workbench 2.31A and later, it is possible to use argument
variables in project options. This makes it possible to make projects more
portable between different environments by avoiding unnecessary absolute
paths. The most obvious use for this is to make include options and xcl-file
options compiler and/or project relative.
<p>Example:
<br>
<ul><br>Setting an include option to "$TOOLKIT_DIR$\inc\" would make the build
tool look for include files in the "inc" subdirectory of the active product
(i.e. standard system includes).
<p>Setting an include option to "$PROJ_DIR$\inc\" would make the
build tool look for include files in the "inc" subdirectory of the current
project directory.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
For more information about what argument variables are available, refer
to the IAR Embedded Workbench User Guide.</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="mcorr"></a>Manual corrections and updates</h3>

<ul>
<h4>
EW 2.31D 2001-11-07</h4>

<ul>
<li>New functionality in the Project window pop-up menu:
<p>Choose Export File List... to save information about which files and
groups the project consists of, in a product-neutral format (which means
that no settings are saved). If you want to import the corresponding information
from another project, choose Import File List...&nbsp; All information
about files or groups that are missing from your current project will be
added from the imported project file list.
<p>These menu options can be useful if you want to migrate a project from
a similar processor family, or if you want to synchronize different stages
of a project.</li></ul>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<h4>
EW 2.31C 2000-03-24</h4>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
The text editor now supports block indent. If you make a selection that
spans multiple rows, pressing tab will indent the selected rows and pressing
shift+tab will unindent. This is very handy in combination with the "Edit->Match
Brackets" command as that allows you to select the block containing the
caret and repeatedly grow the selection if so desired.</li>

<li>
The "Make Control" page of the settings dialog (Options->Settings...),
contains an additional check box option: "Reload last project at startup".
If you uncheck this, the IAR Embedded Workbench will not automatically
load the last project at startup.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
EW 2.31B 1999-11-19</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The IAR XLINK Linker options control panels have been updated to reflect
new IAR XLINK Linker features.</li>

<p>The section "Warnings/Errors" on the "Diagnostics" page contains
three new fields: "Suppress these diagnostics", "Treat these as warnings"
and "Treat these as errors". In these fields you can give a comma- or space-separated
list of diagnostics that you want to reclassify. (This corresponds to the
"-w" command line option.) Example:
<ul>
<pre>"Suppress these diagnostics" w26, e106</pre>
</ul>
The "Output" page contains a new drop-down list "Module-local symbols"
that allow you to specify inclusion of module-local symbols. (This corresponds
to the "-n" command line option.)
<p>For further information about IAR XLINK Linker options, refer to the
file "<a href="xman.htm">xman.htm</a>".</ul>

<h4>
EW 2.31A 1999-05-28</h4>

<ul>
<li>
There are two additional argument variables:</li>

<p>&nbsp;<b>$EW_DIR$</b> that expands to the directory of the IAR Embedded
Workbench, for example "c:\iar\ew23".
<p>&nbsp;<b>$TOOLKIT_DIR$</b> that expands to the directory of the active
product, for example "c:\iar\ew23\AVR".</ul>

<h4>
EW 2.30D 1999-02-17</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Virtual Space mode in the editor Version 2.30D of the IAR Embedded Workbench
introduces a new editor option: "Enable Virtual Space". In virtual space
mode, you can move the text caret into areas that do not contain any text.</li>
</ul>
